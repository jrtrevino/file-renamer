FileRenamer is a simple program to parse movie files into a Plex-readable format. It is currently in development with hopes of supporting TV show parsing.

Usage: python3 movie_parse.py <filename a b ... z> 

In the future, a ping to a movie/tv database website will help enhace the renaming process if information cannot be found.
